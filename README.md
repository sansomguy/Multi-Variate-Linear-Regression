# Multi-Variate Linear Regression in pure C#

## What is this?
I was just wanting to come up with a pure C# implementation of linear regression _[especially one that supports a varying number of features]_.

### Important
While this works, I am not actually sure that its working as it should... :wink: :laughing:

I means as far as I understand the maths, it should work....?
But im just not convinced when I see the calculated coefficients at the end.
They all seems to tend around 0.1ish (including the y intercept... just makes me a little concerned, but not a big deal).

If anyone has some ideas that could either console my heart, or knows what the issue could potentially be, let me know :smile:
